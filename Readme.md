## What
I had an idea to create a small, fun project that I can implement across several languages. This serves as a quick portfolio as well as a way of learning other languages using previous knowledge gained (once I've created the first project, it becomes as simple as converting to the new language).

## Why
I wanted to do something that I could release to the world. Most of the prjects I work on are hidden from the world, behind corporate firewalls.
